# AI Task Automator

The AI Task Automator is a Flask-based web application designed to simplify the process of managing recurring tasks. This project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for users to input task details, including the task name, description, start and end dates, and recurrence interval. The application then prints these details to the console, with the intention of eventually saving them to a database for persistent storage and retrieval.

Key Features:

* User-friendly interface for task input
* Support for recurring tasks with customizable intervals
* Task details are printed to the console for verification

Future Development:

* Integration with a database to store and retrieve task details
* Implementation of a scheduling system to automate task execution
* Expansion of the user interface to include task management and visualization features

This project is designed to be a starting point for more complex task automation systems, with the goal of making it easier for users to manage their tasks and increase productivity.
